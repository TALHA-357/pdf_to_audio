Hello guys this is all in one pdf to audio converter and language translator. User can upload pdfs to extract text, generate its summary, count number of charcters and words, detect language, translate to multiple languages and then generate the audio file for the extracted content. I hope this project will help you a lot. You are free to use it on your own custom usecase and add more functionality into it. Thanks!
